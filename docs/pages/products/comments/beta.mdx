Embed a customizable commenting experience into your product to enable people to
collaborate. Liveblocks Comments is fully customizable, enabling you to create
all kinds of commenting experiences that look and feel like your product. With
comments, you can build things like mentions, thread resolution, text
annotations, video annotations, and more.

Comments is currently in private beta and is only available to a select group of
users. If you want to participate in the beta,
[sign up for the waitlist](https://forms.gle/xgp54aTMsoH8hrjU9). During this
beta period, breaking changes may occur, but no data loss. We use beta testers’
feedback to improve the product. Your input is important and helps us shape the
final version.

## Philosophy

### No need to synchronize your users info with Liveblocks

When posting a comment, we do not store the author name or picture. We only
store the author id. We believe that it’s easier for you to retrieve users
metadata when needed instead of synchronizing your database of users with
Liveblocks.

```tsx
createRoomContext(client, {
  resolveUser: async (userId) => {
    // Fetch user metadata from a local cache or a backend endpoint

    return {
      picture: "/images/marie-curie.png",
      name: "Marie Curie",
    };
  },
});
```

### Webhooks

Webhooks are the foundation for extending Liveblocks in any way you want. You
can subscribe to any comments-related events, such as creation, edition and
deletion.

```tsx
{
  type: "commentCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "acmeinc",
    roomId: "besttrips2023",
    threadId: "th_hhhFMlEx4whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    commentId: "cm_hhhFMlEx3whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    createdAt: "2023-07-04T20:40:28.068Z",
    createdBy: "florent.l",
  }
}
```

With Webhooks, you can leverage your own email marketing tool to send emails,
apply your product’s branding, choose your notification strategy, or even
synchronize threads in Slack.

### Components

To build comments in your application, you have two primary design
implementation pathways:

#### Default components

- The default components are designed to be easily integrated using
  plug-and-play functionality.
- You’ll benefit from our UX and UI expertise incorporated into these
  components.
- Although our components have a default style, you can adjust the CSS to meet
  your needs.
- We constantly improve and update the components to ensure they are optimized
  and current.

```tsx file="App.tsx" highlight="2,9,11"
import { useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config";
import { Composer, Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-comments";

export function App() {
  const threads = useThreads();
  return (
    <div>
      {threads.map((thread) => (
        <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
      ))}
      <Composer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Primitives

- Headless, unstyled components.
- Accessible building blocks to fully customize the experience if CSS is not
  enough.
- Available hooks to access all the context of your threads and comments.

```tsx file="Comment.tsx" highlight="1,8,10"
import { Comment, Timestamp } from "@liveblocks/react-comments/primitives";

export function CustomComment({ comment }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <span>{comment.userId}</span>
        <Timestamp date={comment.createdAt} />
      </div>
      <Comment.Body body={comment.body} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that these two options are not separate paths. Both approaches can be
combined to suit your needs for both speed (default components) and
customization (primitives). One could imagine building their own `<Comment />`
component from scratch using the primitives and still use the default
`<Composer />` component.

### Metadata

With metadata available at the threads level, you can tailor your commenting
experience to your specific needs by refining and shaping it.

Some examples of custom requirements include:

- Anchor threads to specific spots on your platform for contextual discussions
  linked to any aspect of your product.
- Label your threads based on your business logic, like status, priority and
  category.

```tsx
// Example to annotate a video at a specific timestamp
createThread({
  body,
  metadata: {
    timestamp: 42,
  },
});

// Example to start a thread on a specific element in your document
createThread({
  body,
  metadata: {
    elementId: "xxx",
  },
});
```

### Deletion

Deleting a comment from the client, only soft deletes it. We set the
`comment.body` to null. We keep a placeholder so that the missing comment can
still be noticed, giving you the option on how to display deleted comments;
either through a clear “message deleted” indicator or by not displaying it. Note
that we only delete a thread when all its comments have been deleted.

### Inspired by Radix

Our admiration for [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) runs deep. Their approach
to low-level components has been a beacon of inspiration as we crafted our suite
of tools.

- We prioritize making the components usable for everyone.
- The components are designed for complete stylistic customization without
  default style constraints. They are also modular, allowing for easy
  combination and extensibility.
- We minimize dependencies to ensure the components remain efficient and
  lightweight.
