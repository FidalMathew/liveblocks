When a comment is posted, Liveblocks doesn’t store any user metadata, for
example their avatar or name. Instead, it only saves their user ID, which you
manually set when authenticating. To fetch user metadata, we provide functions
that allow you to return the correct data.

This page explains the concepts behind adding users and mentions to Comments. If
you’d prefer a full step-by-step tutorial, make sure to read
[how to add users to Liveblocks Comments](/docs/guides/how-to-add-users-to-liveblocks-comments).

## Authenticate your users

You can set a user’s ID when
[authenticating your application](/docs/rooms/authentication). This ID is then
used inside Comments to represent the current user.

```ts
const session = liveblocks.prepareSession("marc@example.com", {
  userInfo: {
    name: "Marc",
    avatar: "https://example.com/marc.png",

    // Your custom metadata
    // ...
  },
});
```
